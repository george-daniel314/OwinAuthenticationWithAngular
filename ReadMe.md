OwinAuthenticationWithAngular
This repository helps to create an ASP.NET application with various features like token-based authentication, entity framework, angular etc. So, there will be different versions for adding the features one by one. You can clone this repository and checkout with the commit branch mentioned here to get its corresponding version.
Initial template: 
As we are going to begin with token-based authentication, we can start our application by choosing ASP.NET Web Application project from Visual Studio 2017 with framework 4.6.1.  We don’t need any unnecessary files here and thus can choose ‘Empty’ project template and check on the ‘Web API’ to get the folders and core reference. We will be having our on option for authentication so set the authentication option to ‘No Authentication’. And finally, name out project ‘OwinAuthenticationWithAngular.API’.
